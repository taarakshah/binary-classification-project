# binary-classification-project
Predict bike-sharing profit with logistic regression, KNN, random forest.

In this project, I look to predict profit (if ```N_bikes > 20000``` in a given day, the day is profitable) of a bike sharing service. The dataset is straightforward and outlined in the report -- this is primarily to compare the implementation of various ML methods and their effectiveness, as well as understand how to implement them in R. This was one of my first projects in my undergraduate career related to applied ML, and I learned a lot in this undertaking.

Methods: logistic regression, KNN, decision tree, random forest, mean imputation, iterative regression imputation
